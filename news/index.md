# Changelog

## tAge 1.5.0

### Breaking changes

- [`flag_outliers()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/flag_outliers.md)
  replaces
  [`remove_outliers()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/remove_outliers.md),
  as `tage.pp.flag_outliers` does in the Python package, with the same
  numbers. It flags, in the phenoData, samples whose log2(CPM + 1)
  profile (genes with mean CPM \>= 10) is far from the median profile of
  their stratum – robust z of `1 - r` above 5 – and leaves the removal
  to the caller (`eset[, !eset$tage_outlier]`). `method = "pca_iqr"` is
  the paper’s PC1/PC2 1.5-IQR rule on the same input. The removed
  detectors ran PCA on log10(raw counts), where PC1 follows sequencing
  depth; in strata of a dozen samples the 1.5-IQR rule removed normal
  samples in most strata. `robustbase` is no longer suggested.

- [`tage_module_heatmap()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_module_heatmap.md)
  and
  [`load_module_functions()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/load_module_functions.md)
  no longer default to the rodent module set: pass `module_set` (or
  `module_functions`). A module colour names a different module in each
  set – 7 of the 8 colours shared by the rodent and multispecies sets
  differ, “blue” being Respiration/Mitochondrial translation in one and
  Myogenesis/Muscle contraction in the other – so multispecies and human
  module clocks were labelled with rodent functions whenever the
  argument was left out. `module_functions = character(0)` labels the
  rows by module name only.

### Clock registry

- The registry is the Zenodo record 22166800: the 60 composite clocks
  and, new, the published module clocks.
  [`list_module_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/list_module_clocks.md)
  lists the 78 elastic net module clocks of the rodent and multispecies
  sets (one per co-expression module plus `allmodulegenes`,
  chronological and mortality, Scaled normalisation) with their
  annotated function and the archive each set is published as.
  [`download_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/download_clocks.md)
  accepts its output: the archive is downloaded once, unpacked into
  `dest_dir`, and `path` points inside it. Downloads are checked to be a
  pickle or a zip archive. Module clocks are scaled like the composite
  clock of the same outcome.

- Module sets are named `"rodent"`, `"multispecies"` and `"human"`:
  `load_module_functions(module_set = )` and
  `tage_module_heatmap(module_set = )` replace the `version` /
  `modules_version` arguments. The bundled annotation files are
  `Module_to_function_map_<set>.csv`.

- Bundled data files renamed: `Gene_list_rodent_clocks.txt` (the gene
  list of the rodent clocks, read by
  [`load_gene_list()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/load_gene_list.md))
  and `metadata/Orthologs_monkey_to_mouse.csv`.

### New features

- [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
  takes the clock table from
  [`list_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/list_clocks.md)
  /
  [`list_module_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/list_module_clocks.md)
  with a `path` column (e.g. from
  [`download_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/download_clocks.md)):
  every row is applied to the representation its `scaling` names and
  gets a column named after the model file, the names the Python package
  uses. A named list of paths still works; with several paths per
  representation it used to fail with “‘length = 3’ in coercion to
  ‘logical(1)’” and now names its columns by model file, while one path
  per representation keeps the `<representation>_<mode>_tAge` names.
  `mode` and `return_std` default to `NULL`: each model’s type comes
  from the table, the registry or its file name, and Bayesian ridge
  clocks keep their `_sd` column.
  [`tAge_by_group()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tAge_by_group.md)
  follows.
  [`predict_tAge_one()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge_one.md)
  refuses more than one path with a clear message.

### Bug fixes

- [`tage_clock_forest()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_clock_forest.md)
  labels each axis with the unit of its clocks: from `units` keyed by
  prediction column, else from the `"tage_units"` attribute
  [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
  sets (years for primates, percent with `normalized_age = "percent"`),
  else from `units` keyed by outcome. `units` used to be ignored – the
  defaults came first in the lookup, so
  `units = c(Chronological = "years")` still printed “months” – and
  every chronological axis read “months”, human data included. Without
  any unit information a chronological axis now reads “age units”.

- [`tage_adjust_covariates()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_adjust_covariates.md)
  gains `group_column`. With it, the covariate effects removed are those
  of the model the statistics fit (`value ~ group + covariates`, one
  model per stratum, `lm` or the weighted meta-regression), so the
  difference between group means of the adjusted values is the tested
  estimate. The covariate-only model, still the default, attributes part
  of the group effect to covariates that are unevenly distributed across
  groups (tested KO - WT 1.22, plotted 0.91 in an unbalanced example).
  [`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md)
  passes its groups, so its covariate-adjusted points now show what its
  brackets test.

- [`aggregate_pseudobulk()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/aggregate_pseudobulk.md)
  adds cells until a pseudobulk sample reaches `coverage_threshold` and
  then starts the next one, as
  [`aggregate_on_obs_columns()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/aggregate_on_obs_columns.md)
  and the Python package do. It used to cut the cumulative read count at
  multiples of the threshold, so the first sample and about half of the
  others held fewer reads than the threshold, and a cell with more reads
  than the threshold left empty samples (0 cells, 0 counts) behind. Both
  functions gain `drop_incomplete` (as in Python) to drop the leftover
  last sample, and share one implementation that sums with a sparse
  indicator matrix.
  [`aggregate_on_obs_columns()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/aggregate_on_obs_columns.md)
  now respects `verbose`.

- [`tAge_preprocessing()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tAge_preprocessing.md)
  refuses input that is not raw counts – missing, negative or
  non-integer values (TPM, CPM, log data), with the tolerance the Python
  package uses – and a `control_group_column` that does not exist or a
  `control_group_label` that no sample carries; both used to fall back
  to centring on all samples with a warning. A stratum of `split_by`
  without reference samples is still centred on itself with a warning.
  [`control_subtraction()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/control_subtraction.md)
  refuses a column that does not exist.

- [`map_genes()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/map_genes.md)
  keeps Entrez IDs as text from integers when summing identifiers that
  collapse onto one gene. Grouping on the numbers named round IDs in
  scientific notation (rat 500000 became `"5e+05"`), so they matched
  nothing in the ortholog table and were dropped; rat 500000 is the
  ortholog of the clock gene 64945. Duplicates are summed with
  [`rowsum()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/rowsum.html).

- The statistics leave out a categorical covariate that has a single
  level in the data a model is fitted on (e.g. `Sex` in an all-male
  stratum) instead of skipping the stratum on
  [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html)’s “contrasts can be applied
  only to factors with 2 or more levels”. The Python package already
  fitted these strata; the two now agree.

## tAge 1.4.0

### New features

- Species maximum lifespans are the values the clocks were trained with
  (AnAge): rat 3.8 years (was 4.2) and human 122 years (was 122.5);
  mouse 4 and macaque 39 years are unchanged. Chronological-age
  predictions for rat samples are therefore ~10% lower than before,
  human ones ~0.4%.

- One figure style, shared with the Python package:
  [`theme_tage()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/theme_tage.md),
  the colour tokens in
  [`tage_colors()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_colors.md),
  [`tage_series_colors()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_series_colors.md)
  for group colours (the reference group in neutral grey, comparisons in
  colour-vision-safe slots) and
  [`scale_fill_tage_diverging()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/scale_fill_tage_diverging.md)
  for signed effects.
  [`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md),
  [`tage_clock_forest()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_clock_forest.md),
  [`tage_module_heatmap()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_module_heatmap.md),
  the outlier PCA plot and
  [`plot_eset_density()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/plot_eset_density.md)
  all draw with it: left-aligned title with subtitle and caption,
  recessive axes, one colour per clock outcome, blue-grey-red scale
  centred on zero.
  [`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md)
  gains `subtitle` and `caption`; its `theme_type` is deprecated.

- `tAge_preprocessing(split_by = )` preprocesses each level of a
  phenoData column (tissue, dataset, cell type) on its own – gene
  filtering, normalisation and reference centring within the stratum, on
  the stratum’s own controls – and combines the results. This is how the
  clocks were trained and applied in the paper; a single reference
  pooled across tissues mixes tissue differences into the signal.
  [`tAge_by_group()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tAge_by_group.md)
  is now this plus
  [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md),
  and no longer swallows errors per stratum. The bulk vignette
  preprocesses the two-tissue Klotho example this way, with the paper’s
  25% gene-detection threshold.

- Gene identifiers are detected: `gene_mapping_type = "auto"` (the new
  default of
  [`map_genes()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/map_genes.md)
  and
  [`tAge_preprocessing()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tAge_preprocessing.md))
  picks Ensembl, gene symbol or Entrez as the type with the most matches
  in the species’ gene table; Ensembl version suffixes are stripped when
  that is what makes the IDs match. Entrez input is new. Nothing
  matching is an error that lists the match counts.

- The species is recorded in the ExpressionSets returned by
  [`tAge_preprocessing()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tAge_preprocessing.md);
  [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
  /
  [`predict_tAge_one()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge_one.md)
  take it from there (`species = NULL`). `species` is documented as the
  species of the samples, used only to rescale chronological-age clocks;
  an unknown species is an error instead of a silent factor of 1.
  [`tage_species()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_species.md)
  lists the supported species with their maximum lifespans and default
  units.

- [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
  gains `age_units` (“auto”: months for rodents, years for primates; or
  “months” / “years”) and `normalized_age` (“fraction”, the default, or
  “percent” as in the paper and TACO). The result carries a
  `"tage_units"` attribute naming the unit of every prediction column.
  Clocks outside the registry are recognised from their file names
  (Chronoage, Hazard / Mortality, Relage / NormalizedAge); unknown names
  are left on the native scale with a warning.

- `remove_outliers(method = )` adds the paper’s two rules next to the
  Mahalanobis default: `"pca_iqr"` (PC1 or PC2 beyond 1.5 IQR, bulk
  data) and `"spearman_median"` (Spearman correlation with the group’s
  median profile below 0.5, meta-dataset).

### Bug fixes

- [`control_subtraction()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/control_subtraction.md)
  warns when the requested control label matches no sample (it used to
  fall back to all samples silently unless `verbose`).

### Housekeeping

- The Python bridge no longer silences every `UserWarning` for the whole
  session; the scikit-learn version warning is suppressed around the
  model load only.
- Base-package functions are imported explicitly (`R CMD check` NOTEs);
  [`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md)
  no longer calls [`library()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html).
  `png` and `robustbase` are listed in Suggests. The test helper
  downloads models through
  [`download_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/download_clocks.md).
- [`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md)
  needs `ggpubr` only for the bracket layer it draws with it; the
  pkgdown workflow installs it for the vignettes.
- [`download_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/download_clocks.md)
  writes to `<file>.part` and renames only once the transfer is complete
  and checked, so an interrupted session cannot leave a truncated model
  under the real name. Non-ASCII characters in R sources are written as
  `\u` escapes (`R CMD check` warning).

## tAge 1.3.1

### Bug fixes

- `map_genes(species = "monkey")` failed on every input with “subscript
  out of bounds”: macaque genes without a mouse ortholog were looked up
  with `[[`. Mapping is now vectorised and drops those genes, as for the
  other species.

- `tage_clock_forest(clocks_meta = list_clocks(...))` could not find the
  prediction columns:
  [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
  names them `<normalisation>_<mode>_tAge`, not by model file. Registry
  rows are now matched through `scaling` and `type` (Scaled + EN -\>
  `scaled_diff_EN_tAge`), labelled from the registry fields when there
  is no `name` column, and the registry’s “Normalized age” outcome is
  recognised. Two rows landing on one column is an error with an
  explanation.

- [`tage_adjust_covariates()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_adjust_covariates.md)
  with a Bayesian ridge `se_column` and no `split_by` returned
  zero-centred residuals; the values are now put back on the tAge scale
  like every other branch.

- [`tage_compare_groups()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_compare_groups.md),
  [`tage_regress_continuous()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_regress_continuous.md),
  [`tage_module_stats()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_module_stats.md)
  and
  [`tage_adjust_covariates()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_adjust_covariates.md)
  no longer drop a stratum in silence. Every skipped clock/stratum is
  reported with a warning naming it and the reason (reference group
  absent, fewer than two groups, collinear covariates, a failed `lm` /
  `rma.uni` fit, …).

- [`download_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/download_clocks.md)
  raises R’s download timeout while it runs (new `timeout` argument,
  default 3600 s; the default 60 s aborted every Bayesian ridge model,
  0.9-2.4 GB each), removes partial files instead of leaving them to be
  reported as “already present”, and rejects files that are not pickles
  (Zenodo error pages).

- Normalized-age panels of
  [`tage_clock_forest()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_clock_forest.md)
  are labelled “fraction of maximum lifespan”, the scale the package
  actually returns.

## tAge 1.3.0

### New features

- Two publication-style figures built directly on the statistics, so a
  figure and the table behind it cannot drift apart:
  [`tage_clock_forest()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_clock_forest.md)
  draws one clock per row with its confidence interval, filled when it
  survives the multiplicity correction;
  [`tage_module_heatmap()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_module_heatmap.md)
  draws module effects as modules × strata with a star per significant
  cell. Both return the statistics as the `"tage_stats"` attribute, and
  both accept a precomputed table via `stats =`.
  [`load_module_functions()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/load_module_functions.md)
  reads the bundled module-to-function annotation used for the row
  labels.

- The statistics gain `ci_low` / `ci_high` and a `conf_level` argument.
  The critical value follows the test: normal for the Bayesian ridge
  meta-regression, t otherwise.

- Statistical tests matching the TACO / tClock reference application:
  [`tage_compare_groups()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_compare_groups.md)
  for marginal-mean contrasts between groups,
  [`tage_regress_continuous()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_regress_continuous.md)
  for slopes against a numeric predictor,
  [`tage_module_stats()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_module_stats.md)
  for module-clock heatmaps,
  [`tage_adjust_covariates()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_adjust_covariates.md)
  for the matching plotting values, and
  [`tage_significance_stars()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_significance_stars.md)
  for the `*** ** * ^` labels. Elastic net clocks use `lm` + `emmeans`;
  Bayesian ridge clocks use
  [`metafor::rma.uni`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.uni.html)
  weighted by the per-sample prediction standard deviation, reporting
  z-tests. `emmeans` and `metafor` are new imports.

- [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
  and
  [`predict_tAge_one()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge_one.md)
  gain `return_std`, on by default for `mode = "BR"`, adding a
  `<normalisation>_BR_tAge_sd` column. These are the weights the
  Bayesian ridge tests need, and were previously discarded.

- [`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md)
  defaults to `stat_method = "emmeans"`, annotating brackets from
  [`tage_compare_groups()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_compare_groups.md)
  and supporting covariates, per-stratum models and Bayesian ridge
  weighting. Passing any other `stat_method` keeps the previous
  [`ggpubr::stat_compare_means()`](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/stat_compare_means.html)
  behaviour.

### Bug fixes

- The predictive standard deviation of chronological-age clocks is now
  rescaled by the species maximum lifespan along with the prediction
  itself. It was left on the normalised scale, which would have made
  meta-regression weights wrong by the square of the species factor.

## tAge 1.1.0

Corrects three bugs that produced **wrong predictions** in 1.0.0 /
1.0.1. Analyses run with those versions should be repeated with 1.1.0.

### Bug fixes

- Species rescaling is now applied **only to chronological-age clocks**.
  Previously every prediction was multiplied by the species
  maximum-lifespan factor, which turned mortality output (`log10` hazard
  ratio) and normalized-age output into meaningless numbers. The clock
  type is taken from the model file name, matching the TACO reference
  application.

- Reference centring is **never skipped**.
  [`control_subtraction()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/control_subtraction.md)
  used to return the data unchanged when no reference group was given.
  All distributed clocks are relative (`_scaleddiff` / `_yugenediff`)
  models trained on reference-centred expression, so predictions made
  without centring were invalid. `column_name` and `control_label` now
  default to `NULL`, which centres on all samples (overall per-gene
  median) — the TACO default.

- Genes absent from the input are padded with `NA` instead of `0` when
  aligning to the clock gene list. The trained model’s imputer then
  fills them with the training-set median for that gene, which is the
  correct neutral value.

- [`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
  coerces the reticulate result to a `data.frame`, fixing a failure on
  reticulate/pandas versions that return a bare vector for a
  single-column result.

- [`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md)
  is exported.

### New features

- Clock registry:
  [`list_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/list_clocks.md)
  browses the pre-trained models (filter by type, outcome, species,
  tissue and scaling) and
  [`download_clocks()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/download_clocks.md)
  fetches them from Zenodo record 18763485, returning the table with a
  `path` column. The registry ships with the package as
  `inst/extdata/clocks_metadata.csv`.

### Documentation

- Two vignettes replace the former Jupyter notebooks:
  [`vignette("tage-bulk")`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/articles/tage-bulk.md)
  for bulk RNA-seq and
  [`vignette("tage-singlecell")`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/articles/tage-singlecell.md)
  for the pseudobulk single-cell workflow.

- pkgdown site at <https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/>.

- README rewritten: units of each clock outcome, the role of reference
  groups in relative clocks, supported species, and licensing.

- [`scale_eset()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/scale_eset.md)
  documents that scaling is **per sample** (column-wise, each sample
  scaled across genes). Per-gene standardisation happens separately
  inside the trained model, using training-set statistics.

### Testing

- `testthat` suite covering the clock registry, prediction and
  preprocessing.
