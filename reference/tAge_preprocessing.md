# Complete preprocessing pipeline for tAge analysis

This function performs a complete preprocessing pipeline for
transcriptomic age analysis, including gene filtering, normalization,
transformation, scaling, control subtraction, and gene ID conversion. It
returns multiple versions of the processed data suitable for different
analysis approaches.

## Usage

``` r
tAge_preprocessing(
  eset,
  species = "mouse",
  gene_mapping_type = "auto",
  verbose = TRUE,
  control_group_column = NULL,
  control_group_label = NULL,
  count_threshold = 10,
  percent_threshold = 20,
  split_by = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- eset:

  An ExpressionSet object containing raw integer counts (no NA, no
  negative or non-integer values; normalised data are refused).

- species:

  Species of the samples: "mouse", "rat", "human" or "monkey" (see
  [`tage_species`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_species.md)).
  Default is "mouse".

- gene_mapping_type:

  Identifier type of the row names: "Ensembl", "Gene.Symbol", "Entrez"
  or "auto" (default, detected from the gene table; see
  [`map_genes`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/map_genes.md)).

- verbose:

  Logical indicating whether to print progress messages. Default is
  TRUE.

- control_group_column:

  Character string specifying the column name in phenoData that contains
  control group labels. Default is NULL.

- control_group_label:

  Character string specifying the label for control samples. Default is
  NULL. With `split_by`, the controls of each stratum are its reference;
  a stratum without controls is centred on all of its samples, with a
  warning. A column that does not exist, or a label that no sample
  carries, is an error.

- count_threshold:

  Numeric threshold for minimum expression count in gene filtering.
  Default is 10.

- percent_threshold:

  Numeric threshold for minimum percentage of samples that must have
  expression above count_threshold. Default is 20.

- split_by:

  Character or NULL. Column of the phenoData whose levels (tissues,
  datasets, cell types) are preprocessed separately. Default NULL.

## Value

A list containing six processed ExpressionSet objects:

- RLE_normalized:

  RLE-normalized data

- log_transformed:

  Log-transformed data

- scaled:

  Scaled data with gene ID conversion

- scaled_diff:

  Scaled data with control subtraction and gene ID conversion

- yugene:

  YuGene-normalized data with gene ID conversion

- yugene_diff:

  YuGene-normalized data with control subtraction and gene ID conversion

## Details

The clocks were trained on expression centred within each dataset and
tissue against matched controls, and that is how they should be applied:
with several tissues (or datasets, cell types) in one ExpressionSet,
pass `split_by` so that gene filtering, normalisation and reference
centring all happen within each stratum, and the results are combined
afterwards. Without `split_by` the whole object is one stratum.

The species is recorded in every returned ExpressionSet, so
[`predict_tAge`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md)
does not need it again.
