# Subtract reference group median from expression data (relative expression)

This function converts expression into relative (differential)
expression by subtracting the per-gene median of a reference group from
every sample. The distributed `_diff` clocks are relative models trained
on reference-centred expression, so this centring must always be applied
before predicting with them.

## Usage

``` r
control_subtraction(
  eset,
  column_name = NULL,
  control_label = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- eset:

  An ExpressionSet object containing expression data.

- column_name:

  Character string specifying the column name in phenoData that contains
  the group labels. Default `NULL` (centre on all samples).

- control_label:

  Character string specifying the label for control samples. Default
  `NULL` (centre on all samples).

- verbose:

  Logical indicating whether to print progress messages and create
  density plots. Default is TRUE.

## Value

An ExpressionSet object with reference-centred expression data.

## Details

If no reference group is specified (both `column_name` and
`control_label` are `NULL`), or no matching control samples are found,
all samples are used as the reference (per-gene overall median).
Centring itself is never skipped.

## Examples

``` r
# Load example data and create ExpressionSet
expr_data <- load_example_expression_data()
meta_data <- load_example_metadata()
eset <- make_ExpressionSet(expr_data, meta_data)
#> ✓ ExpressionSet created successfully
#>   - Number of genes: 57010 
#>   - Number of samples: 24 


# Centre on the wild-type samples
control_eset <- control_subtraction(eset, "Genotype", "WT", verbose = TRUE)
#> ✓ Control samples found for label 'WT'. Using control group median for subtraction.
#> Warning: NaNs produced
```
