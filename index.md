# tAge

![tAge logo](reference/figures/logo-full.svg)

R package for transcriptomic biological age prediction from gene
expression data, implementing the transcriptomic clocks from
[Tyshkovskiy et al. (2026),
*Nature*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-026-10542-3).

The clocks predict two kinds of biological age from bulk RNA-seq (or
pseudobulk single-cell) expression: **chronological age** and **expected
mortality**. tAge handles preprocessing, normalisation, gene mapping
across species, and prediction with the pre-trained Elastic Net (EN) and
Bayesian Ridge (BR) models.

## Installation

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Gladyshev-Lab/tAge")
```

### Python dependency

tAge calls Python (via
[`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)) to run the model
predictions. Create a virtual environment with the packages listed in
`inst/python/requirements.txt`:

``` bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r inst/python/requirements.txt   # joblib pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

Point R at that interpreter **before** calling
[`predict_tAge()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/predict_tAge.md):

``` r

# Linux / macOS
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = ".venv/bin/python")
# Windows
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = ".venv/Scripts/python.exe")
```

## Clock models

Models are published on Zenodo ([record
22166800](https://zenodo.org/records/22166800)): 60 composite clocks as
single files and the rodent and multispecies module clocks as two
archives. The bundled registry mirrors the record; list and download
from R:

``` r

library(tAge)

# Browse available clocks (filter by type / outcome / species / tissue / scaling)
list_clocks(type = "EN", outcome = "Mortality")

# Download a chosen set; returns the table with a `path` column
clocks <- list_clocks(type = "EN", outcome = "Mortality",
                      species = "Multispecies", tissue = "Multi-Tissue")
clocks <- download_clocks(clocks, dest_dir = "clocks")

model_paths <- list(
  scaled_diff = clocks$path[clocks$scaling == "Scaled"],
  yugene_diff = clocks$path[clocks$scaling == "YuGene"]
)

# Module clocks: one file per co-expression module, fetched as one archive per
# set ("Rodents" or "Multispecies") and unpacked into dest_dir
modules <- download_clocks(list_module_clocks(outcome = "Mortality", species = "Rodents"),
                           dest_dir = "clocks")
```

## Quick start

### Bulk RNA-seq

``` r

library(tAge)
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = ".venv/bin/python")

# 1. Load raw counts (genes x samples) and sample metadata (samples x variables)
exprs_data <- read.csv("expression_matrix.csv", row.names = 1)
metadata   <- read.csv("metadata.csv", row.names = 1)
eset <- make_ExpressionSet(exprs_data, metadata)

# 2. Preprocess: filter, map genes, RLE-normalise, log, scale, YuGene, centre.
#    Gene identifiers (Ensembl / Gene.Symbol / Entrez) are detected automatically.
#    With several tissues, preprocess and centre each on its own controls:
tAge_eset <- tAge_preprocessing(
  eset,
  species = "mouse",
  split_by = "Tissue",
  control_group_column = "Genotype", control_group_label = "WT"
)

# 3. Predict (the species was recorded by tAge_preprocessing). The clock table
#    from download_clocks() can be passed as is: one column per clock, named
#    after the model file, as in the Python package.
results <- predict_tAge(tAge_eset, clocks)
head(results)
attr(results, "tage_units")   # unit of every prediction column
```

A named list, `list(scaled_diff = ..., yugene_diff = ...)`, works too:
with one model per representation the columns are `scaled_diff_EN_tAge`
and `yugene_diff_EN_tAge`, with several they are named after the model
files.

`species` is the species of the *samples* and only sets the maximum
lifespan used to express chronological-age clocks in months (rodents) or
years (primates); it is not the species group a clock was trained on.
`age_units` forces months or years, and `normalized_age = "percent"`
reports normalized-age clocks as a percentage of the expected maximum
lifespan, as the paper does.

### Single-cell (pseudobulk)

``` r

library(Seurat)

eset <- aggregate_on_obs_columns(
  seurat_obj,
  obs_column_names = c("sample_id", "tissue"),
  coverage_threshold = 1e7
)
eset <- flag_outliers(eset, split_by = "tissue")   # adds eset$tage_outlier
eset_clean <- eset[, !eset$tage_outlier]

results <- tAge_by_group(
  eset_clean,
  split_by = "tissue",
  model_paths = model_paths,
  species = "mouse",
  mode = "EN",
  control_group_column = "age",
  control_group_label  = "young"
)
```

## Statistics

[`tage_compare_groups()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_compare_groups.md)
and friends implement the statistical models of the paper’s clock
analyses; the R and Python packages agree numerically. Elastic net
clocks are compared with estimated marginal-mean contrasts of
`value ~ group + covariates` (`emmeans` on an `lm`); Bayesian ridge
clocks go through a REML meta-regression
([`metafor::rma.uni`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.uni.html))
that weights each sample by its own prediction standard deviation and
reports z-tests.

``` r

# BR predictions carry a matching <column>_sd column.
results <- predict_tAge(tAge_eset, model_paths, species = "mouse", mode = "BR")

tage_compare_groups(
  results,
  value_columns   = "yugene_diff_BR_tAge",
  group_column    = "Genotype",
  reference_group = "WT",
  covariates      = "Sex",
  split_by        = "Tissue",
  se_columns      = "yugene_diff_BR_tAge_sd",   # BR clocks only
  p_adjust        = "BH"
)
```

One row per contrast, with `estimate` always meaning `group2 - group1`,
plus `se`, a 95% interval in `ci_low` / `ci_high`, `statistic`, `df`,
`p_value`, `p_adjusted` and a `label` holding the usual `*** ** * ^`
stars.

| Function | Description |
|----|----|
| [`tage_compare_groups()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_compare_groups.md) | marginal-mean contrasts between groups |
| [`tage_regress_continuous()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_regress_continuous.md) | slope of tAge against a numeric predictor |
| [`tage_module_stats()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_module_stats.md) | per-module effect sizes and p-values for module clocks |
| [`tage_adjust_covariates()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_adjust_covariates.md) | covariate-adjusted values matching what the model tested |
| [`tage_significance_stars()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_significance_stars.md) | `*** ** * ^` labels |

Two figures are built directly on those tests, and return the statistics
as the `"tage_stats"` attribute:

| Function | Description |
|----|----|
| [`tage_clock_forest()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_clock_forest.md) | one clock per row, effect with 95% CI, filled = survives the correction |
| [`tage_module_heatmap()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_module_heatmap.md) | module effects as a heatmap, modules × strata; `module_set` (“rodent”, “multispecies”, “human”) picks the row annotation |

``` r

p <- tage_clock_forest(
  results, clocks_meta = clocks,
  group_column = "Genotype", reference_group = "WT", split_by = "Tissue"
)
```

Every figure is drawn with
[`theme_tage()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/theme_tage.md)
from one set of colour tokens
([`tage_colors()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_colors.md)),
the same as the Python package: groups take colour-vision-safe
categorical slots in a fixed order with the reference group in grey
([`tage_series_colors()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_series_colors.md)),
each clock outcome keeps its colour across figures, signed effects use
one blue–grey–red scale centred on zero, and text never wears a data
colour. Add
[`theme_tage()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/theme_tage.md)
to your own ggplots to match.

A `ggplot` carries no size of its own, so the figure functions record
the size they were designed for and grow it with the number of clocks,
modules and panels.
[`tage_save_plot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_save_plot.md)
uses that size;
[`tage_fig_size()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_fig_size.md)
reads it back for a knitr chunk:

``` r

tage_fig_size(p)                       # width and height in inches
tage_save_plot(p, "forest.png")        # saved at the recorded size
tage_save_plot(p, "forest.pdf", width = 7)   # override just the width

# or fix the size up front
tage_clock_forest(..., width = 7, height = 4.5)
tage_clock_forest(..., row_height = 0.22, panel_width = 4.0)
tage_module_heatmap(..., cell_height = 0.28, cell_width = 0.9)
```

`variance_strata` chooses whether the residual variance comes from the
two compared groups (`"subset"`) or from every group in the stratum
(`"all_data"`); `p_adjust_scope` chooses the correction family —
`"within_column"` across comparisons and strata of one clock,
`"across_columns"` across clocks or modules within a comparison and
stratum, or `"global"`.

[`tage_boxplot()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_boxplot.md)
uses this engine by default (`stat_method = "emmeans"`); pass
`stat_method = "t.test"` (or another
[`ggpubr::stat_compare_means`](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/stat_compare_means.html)
method) for a plain two-sample test.

## Interpreting the output

The units of the prediction depend on the clock **outcome**:

| Outcome | Column | Units | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|
| Chronological | `*_tAge` | months (rodents) or years (primates); `age_units` overrides | normalised age rescaled by species max lifespan ([`tage_species()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_species.md)) |
| Mortality | `*_tAge` | `log10(hazard ratio)` | **not** an age; higher = higher expected mortality |
| Normalized age | `*_tAge` | fraction of max lifespan, or `%` with `normalized_age = "percent"` | age / expected maximum lifespan of the experimental model |

Only **chronological** clocks are rescaled to age units. Mortality
clocks output a `log10` hazard ratio and must **not** be interpreted in
years — tAge derives this automatically from the clock registry (and
from the file name for models outside it). The `"tage_units"` attribute
of the result records the unit of every column.

## Relative (differential) clocks and centring

All distributed clocks are **relative** (`_scaleddiff` / `_yugenediff`)
models: they operate on expression *centred against a reference group*.
[`tAge_preprocessing()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tAge_preprocessing.md)
centres the data automatically:

- **No reference group given (default):** centres on all samples
  (overall per-gene median). Use this for a general age/mortality
  readout of a cohort.
- **Reference group given:** pass `control_group_column` and
  `control_group_label` to centre on age-/sex-matched controls within
  your design (recommended when comparing treatment vs control).
- **Several tissues, datasets or cell types:** pass `split_by`. The
  clocks were trained on expression centred *within each dataset and
  tissue*, so filtering, normalisation and centring must happen per
  stratum; a single reference pooled across tissues mixes tissue
  differences into the signal.
  [`tAge_by_group()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tAge_by_group.md)
  does the same and predicts in one call.

The bundled example is the Klotho-knockout dataset of the paper (kidney
and skeletal muscle, WT vs KO). Note that the distributed clocks contain
the *Klotho* gene itself, whereas the paper’s Klotho analysis used
clocks retrained without it; expect the KO effect here to be somewhat
larger.

## Supported species

Mouse, human, rat, monkey
([`tage_species()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/tage_species.md)).
Non-mouse species are mapped to mouse orthologs internally, so all
clocks operate in the mouse Entrez gene space. Input identifiers may be
Ensembl (with or without version suffix), gene symbols or Entrez IDs;
[`map_genes()`](https://gladyshev-lab.github.io/tAge/reference/map_genes.md)
detects which.
